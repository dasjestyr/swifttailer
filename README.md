# UI redesign is underway! Material Design incoming...

SwiftTailer is an open-source log tailer application that was put together to address some short-comings of other popular .Net log tailing projects in terms of how *we* needed to use it at my current job. We have been having so much success with this log monitor that I decided we should share it with the community. This is also my first real attempt at WPF/XAML so it also doubled as a learning project.

This tailer focuses on the idea of tailing multiple logs simultaneously and also saving pre-defined "group" or "sessions" which should prove useful in scenarios where you have many logs to monitor across different environments. For example, if you have 20 different logs that you want to monitor in 3 different environments, such as dev, staging, and production, then you can preconfigure these groups with all of the corresponding file locations so that you can quickly switch between them.

## Project Goals
  - Use modern practices and patterns as of .Net 4.5.1 / C# 6
  - Low CPU usage
  - Do not overwhelm the UI with options, try to get operations contextual and sematic
  - Keep the UI somewhat responsive
  - Do not overdo search options in the main view. Advanced searching and log parsing should be done somewhere other than the main view as not to overcomplicate the basic functionality.
  - Contributors should take their time in adding new functionality and keep clean, SOLID code that is easy to follow so that others may understand and contribute


## Currently implemented functionality: 

### Logging:
 - Create/Delete logging group
 - Create/Delete log from group
 - Monitor all logs in real-time
 - Open single log
 - Go to log in explorer
 - Follow tail
 - View selection
 - Rename log
 - Retarget log
 
### Selection Tools:
 - Save to file
 - Email selection
 - Compare selection (in selection view) with clipboard contents
 - Ping selection (in selection view)
 
### Search
 - Search
   - Literal
   - Regex
 - Case sensitivity
 - Filter
   - With lines of context
 - Sticky search
   - search errors
   - search misc
 
### Application Settings
 - Max lines
 - Max file read size
 - Polling interval
 - User email (to use as From: field in emails)
 - Font face for logs
 - Auto follow tail on open
 
### Tools

 - Zip and email log group
 - Export log group configuration
 - Import log group configuration
   - Replace
   - Merge
 - Browse to application folder

### Required to Run
